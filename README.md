# EMG-Muscle-Strain-Detector
A fully analog EMG-based muscle strain detector with real-time LED feedback

## Key Features:
- A portable device made entirely by analog components that effectively monitors EMG signals using three wet electrodes.
- Real-time feedback with LEDs indicating strain levels (low, medium, high).
- Powered by two 9V batteries for extended usage and portability.
- Incorporates an instrumentation amplifier, second-order low-pass filters, a precision full-wave rectifier, and a comparator for efficient EMG signal processing

## How to Use
1. Connect three wet electrodes to the designated locations.
2. Power the device using two 9V batteries.
3. Observe the LED indicators for strain level feedback.
